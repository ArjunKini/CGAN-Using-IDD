# CGAN-Using-IDD
Using Pix2Pix on Indian Driving Dataset.

Project Title: Scene Generation Using Deep Learning

Description:
Our project aims to use GANs to generate realistic images from a purely semantic representation of a scene. We
survey and compare models that can be used on any kind of scene and then train these architectures on an unexplored
dataset - The Indian Driving Dataset. Through this project, we can arrive at answers to the following questions.
One, the scope of generative adversarial networks in interpreting and understanding textures and variables in a
complex scene. Two, the applications of such a model in the field of gaming and virtual reality.

Running:
-Train a model using Jupyter Notebook in model folder
-Deploy model using Flask

Dataset from http://idd.insaan.iiit.ac.in/
Unity files will be uploaded soon!
